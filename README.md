# CIS 3500-001 — Project Ideation — Spring 2025

This repository is for the ideation of the project. It is a place to share ideas and discuss them.

## How to use `TEMPLATE-1.md`

Accurately filling out the template is crucial for the success of your project. The template is designed to help you think through your idea and present it clearly.

⚠️ Make sure to **replace any text in brackets** with your own content. The brackets are there to help you understand what to put in each section. For example, if it says `[Title]`, replace it with the title of your idea.

⚠️ **Do not include the brackets in your final submission.**

⚠️ Make sure to **delete any text in italics** (i.e., _this_) before submitting. The italics are there to help you understand what to put in each section. For example, if it says _[Include your name(s) here]_, replace it with your name(s).

## In-Class Ideation (Rounds 1-3)

For this phase, use [`TEMPLATE-1.md`](TEMPLATE-1.md) to structure your ideas, replace the prompts in between brackets, and submit using a pull request in folders `round1`, `round2`, and `round3`.

### At Each Round

- [Create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
- Write a new file in the `roundX` directory with your PennKey and the `.md` extension (i.e., I would write a file called `lumbroso.md`) according to `TEMPLATE.md` (see also `SAMPLE-1.md` and `SAMPLE-2.md` for examples).
- [Create a pull request from the fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

### Rounds

Here are how the rounds are structured:

- **Round 1 (15-20 mins):** Think on your own about a single story that you will submit in `round1` directory.
- **Round 2 (15-20 mins):**
  - Pair up with someone else,
  - Each present each other's idea (5 mins)
  - Determine which idea is the one you most would like to work on (2 min)
  - Expand the idea with 5 more user stories (8 mins)
  - Submit the expanded idea in `round2` directory under the name of the person who's idea it originally was.
- **Round 3 (15-20 mins):**
  - Pair up with another pair (4 people in total, 2 ideas)
  - Each present each other's idea (5 mins)
  - Determine which idea is the one you most would like to work on (2 min)
  - Expand the idea with 5 more user stories (8 mins)
  - Submit the expanded idea in `round2` directory under the name of the person who's idea it originally was.
